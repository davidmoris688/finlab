    This method creates `n_series` time series of length `t_samples`. Each time series is divided
    into `k_corr_clusters` correlation clusters. Each correlation cluster is subdivided into
    `d_dist_clusters` distribution clusters.
    A main distribution is sampled from a normal distribution with mean = 0 and stdev = 1, adjusted
    by a `rho_main` factor. The correlation clusters are sampled from a given distribution, are generated
    once, and adjusted by a `rho_corr` factor. The distribution clusters are sampled from other
    given distributions, and adjusted by (1 - `rho_main` - `rho_corr`). They are sampled for each time series.
    These three series are added together to form a time series of returns. The final time series
    is the cumulative sum of the returns, with a start price given by `price_start`.

    :param n_series: (int) Number of time series to generate.
    :param t_samples: (int) Number of samples in each time series.
    :param k_corr_clusters: (int) Number of correlation clusters in each time series.
    :param d_dist_clusters: (int) Number of distribution clusters in each time series.
    :param rho_main: (float): Strength of main time series distribution.
    :param rho_corr: (float): Strength of correlation cluster distribution.
    :param price_start: (float) Starting price of the time series.
    :param dists_clusters: (list) List containing the names of the distributions to sample from.
        The following numpy distributions are available: "normal" = normal(0, 1), "normal_2" = normal(0, 2),
        "student-t" = standard_t(3)/sqrt(3), "laplace" = laplace(1/sqrt(2)). The first disitribution
        is used to sample for the correlation clusters (k_corr_clusters), the remaining ones are used
        to sample for the distribution clusters (d_dist_clusters).
    :return: (pd.DataFrame) Generated time series. Has size (t_samples, n_series).
