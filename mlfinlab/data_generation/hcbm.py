    Helper function for `generate_hcmb_mat` that recursively places rho values to HCBM matrix
    given as an input.

    By using a uniform distribution we select the start and end locations of the blocks in the
    matrix. For each block, we recurse depth times and repeat splitting up the sub-matrix into
    blocks. Each depth level has a unique correlation (rho) values generated from a uniform
    distributions, and bounded by `rho_low` and `rho_high`. This function works as a
    side-effect to the `mat` parameter.
